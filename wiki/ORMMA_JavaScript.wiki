#summary ORMMA JavaScript API that all ad developers can use.
#sidebar SideBar

=Introduction=
The adoption of the ORMMA standard allows all ad developers to use the same !JavaScript methods and know that their ad will behave as expected on a variety of platforms.

This page outlines all the methods and events that ad developers will have access to.

<wiki:toc max_depth="3" />


=Methods=
_`*`methods marked with an asterisk are dependent on the device. Ad developers and SDK implementers must use the supports() method to identify what methods are available._


==addAsset==
{{{
addAsset(URL, alias)
}}}

This method returns no value and executes asynchronously, but the alias can be used immediately in ad content. If the alias is referenced before the asset has loaded, the object simply does not return to the web viewer until it has loaded. The addAsset call can also support the following special keywords for assets that come from the native device.

|| *value*                              || *description* ||
||ormma://screenshot        ||capture a screenshot of the application and save as an asset`*`||
||ormma://photo                ||capture a photo using the devices camera and save as an asset`*`||

_`*`Requires device support_

  parameters:
    * URL – string, actual URL of the asset
    * alias – string, name that ad developer will use to refer to asset URL

  return values: none

  event triggered: assetReady

  level: 3

==addAssets==
{{{
addAssets(assets)
}}}

This method's parameter - "assets" - is an abstract array (aka standard !JavaScript Object) of alias/uri key-value pairs. The method returns no value and executes asynchronously. Usage rules are the same as adding a single alias.

  parameters: assets – object, description of alias/uri key-value pairs

  return values: none

  event triggered: assetReady

  level: 3

==addEventListener==
{{{
addEventListener(event, listener)
}}}

Use this method to subscribe a specific handler method to a specific event. In this way, multiple listeners can subscribe to a specific event, and a single listener can handle multiple events. The events are:

|| *value*             || *description* ||
||ready             ||report initialize complete||
||network        ||report network connectivity changes||
||keyboard      ||report soft keyboard changes||
||orientation   ||report orientation changes||
||heading        ||report heading changes||
||location        ||report location changes||
||screen           ||report screen size changes||
||shake            ||report device being shaken||
||size                ||report ad size changes||
||state              ||report state changes||
||tilt                  ||report tilt changes||

  parameters:
    * event – string, name of event to listen for
    * listener – function, function name (or anonymous function) to execute

  return values: none

  side effects: registering listeners for device features may power up sensors in the device that will reduce battery life.

  level: 1

==close==

    * body - String, the body of the event

  return value: none

  level: 2

==expand==
{{{
expand(initialDimensions, finalDimensions, URL)
}}}

Use this method to open a separate overlay ad container view at the highest z-order of the window's view.

dimensions: JSON {x, y, width, height} - this object contains desired point value dimensions of the resized web viewer

  parameters:
    * initialDimensions: an object describing the initial position of the overlay view before the expand transition occurs. If null, the position and size of the default view will be used.
    * finalDimensions: the final position of the overlay view after the expand transition occurs

  parameters: none

*properties object*
{{{
properties = {
 "transition" : "default|dissolve|zoom|none",
}
}}}

*"transition"*

  level: 1
 
==makeCall==
{{{
makeCall(number)
}}}

==resize==
{{{
resize(width, height)
}}}

  parameters:
    * width: Number: the width in pixels
    * height: Number: the height in pixels

  return values: none

  events triggered: resizeChange, stateChange
