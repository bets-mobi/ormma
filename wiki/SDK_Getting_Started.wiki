=Getting started with the reference code=
ORMMA is an API that defines a bridge between native layer programming and HTML display. It requires that ad developers follow the rules, as well as SDK providers.

You do _not_ need to include this reference code to be ORMMA compliant. Any SDK that is ORMMA compliant is good enough. The reference implementation is only a convenience to encourage adoption of this important standard.


==Quick Start==
Documentation is available for iOS developers to understand and get started with the reference code.
  * [iOS_Getting_Started]
  * [iOS_Basic_Use_Of_The_RI]

There is a reference for Android as well, but documentation is incomplete at this time. Other platforms will also be added to the source repository as they become available.

Each implementation also has a sample ad included that can also help with your understanding of including the reference in your app.


==Background information==
Some (dated) information about the inner workings is also available. If you can help us keep this up-to-date, please consider joining the ORMMA code group.
